Programming standards:
In ts there is no way to do the following:

	var data = { person: undefined }

	console.log(data.person?.name)

This is a pain in the ass. The js spec states that one should do one of the following:

	console.log(data.person && data.person.name) // if person is undefined undefined is returned else the name

or 

	console.log(data.person !== undefined ? data.person.name : '')
